👋 Hi, I’m @hahahabahinu
👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies, programming languages, and staying active with sports.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced algorithms and data structures, while also training for my next marathon.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that intersect technology and fitness, aiming to solve real-world problems.
🏃‍♂️ When I'm not coding, you can find me on the football field or at the gym.
📫 You can reach me at habahinu@gmail.com
